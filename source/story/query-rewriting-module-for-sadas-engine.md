**SADAS Engine** is a columnar DBMS specifically designed in order to achieve outstanding performances in Data warehouse environments.

It is suitable to all those situations where the user has to deal with a massive amount of historical data. Moreover, these data have to be accessed through always different criteria: we can have to handle bank account movements, phone call records, data collection from GPS devices, and so on.

I worked on the design and implementation of the SADAS View-Rewriting module, in order to speed-up the response time of a query when there is a materialized view useful to do that.

As far as I know Advanced Systems is the only Italian company in this field and it was a pleasure to work with a team so great.
